# Intro
This repo contains the actual smart contract source code used at Mintnite.io.

# How to Use
If you have deployed your smart contract, you may migrate your contract to another third-party contract interface such as MyEtherWallet. But you need to connect the actual wallet with the network that you used to deploy the contract and also include the ABI (Application Binary Interface) when interacting. The ABI files are listed below.

* ERC20.abi - For ERC20 smart contracts (copy and paste the entire text).
* ERC721.abi - For ERC721 NFT and SBT contracts.
